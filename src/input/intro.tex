\section{A \hologo{XeTeX} template for printable academic documents}

This is a custom \hologo{XeTeX} template designed for note taking and posterior printing (hence the serif font).
It's a redesign of \href{https://github.com/advy99}{advy99}'s template, which is a heavy redesign of one \href{https://github.com/Dunspa}{Dunspa} provided us with.
We regretably can't find the primary source anywhere, sorry about that.
The listings style was inspired by \href{https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe}{Wandmalfarbe}'s Eisvogel.

The placeholder image \code{src/titlepage.png} is \textit{Troiana Iris} by Albrecht DÃ¼rer.

A demo is avaliable at the \href{https://github.com/Groctel/aqademia/releases}{releases} page.
