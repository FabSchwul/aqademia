\chapter{About appendices}

\section{Differences over sessions}

While the chapter is declared outside the \code{input} files in the sessions, it is declared as the appendices header.
The \code{section} command is substituted by the \code{subsection} command previously used, so that the style is conserved without losing a sectioning level.

\subsection{Subsections}

The \code{subsection} level is also substituted by \code{subsubsection}.

\section{Numbering}

Appendices are referred to as a letter, starting from letter \code{A}.
