# Aqademia

**A XeTeX template for printable academic documents.**

This is a custom XeTeX template designed for note taking and posterior printing (hence the serif font).
It's a redesign of [advy99](https://github.com/advy99)'s template, which is a heavy redesign of one [Dunspa](https://github.com/Dunspa) provided us with.
We regretably can't find the primary source anywhere, sorry about that.
The listings style was inspired by [Wandmalfarbe](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe)'s Eisvogel.

The placeholder image `src/titlepage.png` is *Troiana Iris* by Albrecht DÃ¼rer.

A demo is avaliable at the [releases](https://github.com/Groctel/aqademia/releases) page.

## Document properties

### Physical properties

This document is designed to be printed in European A4 paper and to fit as much text as possible in a single page without becoming too crowded (check the margins in `marginsrb`).
It uses `fancy` style headers and footers and coloured hyperlinks.

### Argumentos

This template provides some arguments to customize your document:

## Dependencies

The font used in listings is `Libertine Mono` (It is scaled down in inline code sections).

## Building

```bash
cd src
xelatex aqademia.tex
```

## About appendices

### Differences over sessions

While the chapter is declared outside the `input` files in the sessions, it is declared as the appendices header.
The `section` command is substituted by the `subsection` command previously used, so that the style is conserved without losing a sectioning level.

#### Subsections

The `subsection` level is also substituted by `subsubsection`.

### Numbering

Appendices are referred to as a letter, starting from letter `A`.
