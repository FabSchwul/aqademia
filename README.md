# Aqademia

**A TeX template for printable academic documents.**

This is a custom TeX template designed for note taking and posterior printing (hence the serif font).
It's a redesign of [advy99](https://github.com/advy99)'s template, which is a heavy redesign of one [Dunspa](https://github.com/Dunspa) provided us with.
We regretably can't find the primary source anywhere, sorry about that.

The placeholder image `src/titlepage.png` is *Troiana Iris* by Albrecht DÃ¼rer.
