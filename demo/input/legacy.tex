\chapter{Legacy versions}

This template has two legacy versions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{\texttt{aqademia.sty} 1.0:} This is an abomination born from some long lost ritual. No sane human being should ever use this version of the template. Lovecraft should be grateful he didn't live to see this horror.
	\item\textbf{\texttt{aqademia.sty} 2.0:} This version was much better than the previous one but still lacked some core features for a sane LaTeX package. Despite that, some people used it and thus is still provided in the \texttt{legacy/} directory in case someone needs it for a project written with this version.
\end{itemize}

When updating Aqademia to versions newer than 3.0 I will do my best to make it backwards compatible.
If this is not possible, I will leave some reasonable time for the compiler to throw a warning or a non-terminal error before deprecating the old feature.
