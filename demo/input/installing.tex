\section{Installing Aqademia}

Since it's still new, Aqademia has not been submitted to texlive.
However, you can install this template by adding the \texttt{aqademic.cls} file to your project's root directory or by cloning it into your \texttt{\~{}/texmf} directory:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Sh]
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex
git clone https://github.com/Groctel/aqademia ~/texmf/tex/latex/aqademia/
\end{lstlisting}

You can also use the following recipe in you \texttt{Makefile} to install the template in compilation time:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Make]
AQADEMIA = $${HOME}/texmf/tex/latex/aqademia/

aqademia:
	@  (find $(AQADEMIA) \
	   && git -C $(AQADEMIA) pull) \
	|| (mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex \
	   && git clone https://github.com/Groctel/aqademia $(AQADEMIA))
\end{lstlisting}
