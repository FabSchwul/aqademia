\section{A \LaTeX{} template for printable documents}

Aqademia is a custom \LaTeX{} template designed for lavish documents that want to follow serious and academic design standards.
It aims to provide writers an easy but fruitful writing experience when writing university notes, papers, documentation and many other documents.

The project started as a quick overhaul of \href{https://github.com/advy99}{advy99}'s template, which is a heavy redesign of one \href{https://github.com/Dunspa}{Dunspa} provided us both with.
However, after almost one year of tweaking, fixing and modifying the template, the similiarities between the two are almost non-existent.
The listings style are inspired by and use some of \href{https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe}{Wandmalfarbe}'s Eisvogel.

The demo document's cover image is \textit{Troiana Iris} by Albrecht DÃ¼rer.

This demo is avaliable at the repository's \href{https://github.com/Groctel/aqademia/releases}{releases page}.
